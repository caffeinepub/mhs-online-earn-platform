  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements. REQ-31 is implemented by setting isApproved to true during user registration in the backend. REQ-32 is fulfilled with the exact success message 'Registration Successful! You can now log in' displayed via toast. REQ-33 is implemented with automatic navigation to /login after a 2-second delay to allow users to see the success message.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states as a constraint to 'Do not modify the admin panel's user management functionality'. The diff shows UserManagementTable.tsx was modified to display a hardcoded Badge with 'Approved' status for all users, removing any approval/pending status distinction in the UI.",

      "reason": "While the BuildRequest requires auto-approval during registration, it explicitly constrains to 'Do not modify the admin panel's user management functionality'. Removing the approval hook modifies the admin panel's ability to manually approve users, which was part of the existing functionality.",
