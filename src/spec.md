# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the homepage hero section background with the user's uploaded photo and apply a dark overlay with fixed positioning for improved visual appeal and text readability.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the existing circular user photo (1770720033234.jpg) from the hero section
- Set the uploaded user photo (1770720033234-1.jpg) as the hero section background image with cover sizing and center positioning
- Apply a semi-transparent dark overlay (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)) over the background image to ensure white text remains readable
- Configure the background with CSS background-attachment: fixed so it stays stationary during page scrolling

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage hero section will display the user's photo as a fixed background with a dark overlay, creating a professional appearance while maintaining clear readability of all text and buttons. The background will remain stationary while scrolling the page.
