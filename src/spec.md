# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Auto-approve new user registrations and streamline the post-registration flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Set new user accounts to 'Approved' status by default in the backend
- Update registration success message to "Registration Successful! You can now log in"
- Auto-redirect users to the login page after successful registration

**User-visible outcome:** Users can register and immediately log in without waiting for admin approval, with clear messaging and automatic redirection to the login page.
